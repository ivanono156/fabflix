# Connection Pooling
  #### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of using JDBC Connection Pooling.
  #### WebContent/META-INF/context.xml, pom.xml, src/JdbcConstants.java
  #### Explain how Connection Pooling is utilized in the Fabflix code.
  #### We use connection pooling by reusing database connections in our serlvets when a request is made. We use this for load balancing between, the master and slave instances that we created. This helps to distribute tasks between the two servers.
  #### Explain how Connection Pooling works with two backend SQL.
  #### Connection Poolling works by pooling all read/write requests and connecting them to the primary database in the Master instance. All of the read requests get pooled together and get connected to the secondary database in the slave instance. We set up these two connections in our context.xml file.
    

# Master/Slave
#### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of routing queries to Master/Slave SQL.

#### How read/write requests were routed to Master/Slave SQL?
Two data sources are created in the context.xml file: read/write operations are sent to "jdbc/moviedbReadWrite", and 
read-only operations are sent to "jdbc/moviedbReadOnly". These two resources are registered in the web.xml file under 
the same name. The read/write data source contains a connection to the aws instance that has the master mysql on it, and 
the read-only data source contains a connection to the aws instance that has the slave mysql on it.
