# Connection Pooling
  #### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of using JDBC Connection Pooling.
    
  #### Explain how Connection Pooling is utilized in the Fabflix code.
  #### We use connection pooling by reusing database connections in our serlvets when a request is made. We use this for load balancing between, the master and slave instances that we created. This helps to distribute tasks between the two servers.
  #### Explain how Connection Pooling works with two backend SQL.
  #### Connection Poolling works by pooling all read/write requests and connecting them to the primary database in the Master instance. All of the read requests get pooled together and get connected to the secondary database in the slave instance.
    

# Master/Slave
#### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of routing queries to Master/Slave SQL.

#### How read/write requests were routed to Master/Slave SQL?
Two data sources are created in the context.xml file: read/write operations are sent to "jdbc/moviedbReadWrite", and 
read-only operations are sent to "jdbc/moviedbReadOnly". These two resources are registered in the web.xml file under 
the same name. The read/write data source contains a connection to the aws instance that has the master mysql on it, and 
the read-only data source contains a connection to the aws instance that has the slave mysql on it. When a servlet needs
to read items from the database, such as by using a SELECT statement, the website can send requests to either the master
or slave SQLs. However, if a servlet needs to write to the database, such as by using an INSERT statement, the requests 
are sent ONLY to the master SQL.

# Extra Credit - Fuzzy Search
####  Include a brief explanation of the design and the implementation of your fuzzy Search.
Our fuzzy search uses a combination of full text searching and the LEDA algorithm implemented in the 'edth' user defined
function from the flamingo library. The edit distance threshold to determine whether two strings are similar is 25% of 
the length of the user's search query, rounded down, with a minimum threshold of 1 for all queries. For example, a
search query with a length of 10 characters will have its edit distance threshold set to 2. The fuzzy search takes the 
union of results returned from full text searching and from the 'edth' function by using an 'or' operator.
